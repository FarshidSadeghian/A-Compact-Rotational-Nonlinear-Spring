# A-Compact-Rotational-Nonlinear-Spring
This code is part of my final project for Dr. Zakerzadeh's "Advanced Dynamic" course during my master's program.
To run the code, please use the Matlab function "RotNonLinearSpringAppr". The idea behind of this code consists of a follower, rolling on the cam profile.
A tension spring connects the centre of the cam to the centre of the follower, ensuring its contact with the cam. The mechanism applies torque in the direction which causes spring length to decrease.
A torque applied on the mechanism opposite to this direction stores energy within the spring. The tension of the spring and the profile of the cam will cause a torque which is in accordance with angle.
Using the required torque based on ankle angle and choosing the mechanism specifications (follower diameter, spring stiffness, initial and secondary length) the differential equations governing the cam profile are obtained.

Since the type and the levels of muscular weakness change from patient to patient, a single orthosis cannot enhance each patient's gait pattern, and a patient-specific study via motion analysis should take place.
For each patient, motion analysis experiments were utilised to optimise the torque required to correct the kinematics based on muscle activation and activity during the gait cycle.
To model individuals with muscular weakness and determine the force necessary to mimic healthy ankle joint stiffness, OpenSim was used.
By developing a patient-specific orthosis, the healthy joint stiffness profile for each patient may be restored. You can find more details about it in the attached report.
